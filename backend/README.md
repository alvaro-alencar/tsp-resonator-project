This repository contains the complete implementation of the **TSP Resonator**, a novel meta-heuristic that successfully solved the canonical `berlin52.tsp` benchmark, achieving the globally optimal solution. The project demonstrates a powerful synergy between a unique physics-inspired initialization heuristic and a robust Iterated Local Search (ILS) framework.

## Abstract

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most studied NP-hard problems in combinatorial optimization. This project introduces a novel methodology, originating from the "SAT Resonator" concept, to tackle the TSP. The core idea is to generate a high-quality initial tour by ordering cities based on a finite harmonic series, effectively creating a "resonant" path structure. This tour is then aggressively optimized using a "Best Improvement" 2-Opt local search embedded within an Iterated Local Search (ILS) framework. The ILS enables the search to escape local optima by applying strategic perturbations (double-bridge moves), leading to superior convergence properties. When applied to the `berlin52` TSPLIB instance, this methodology successfully found the known global optimum of **7542**, demonstrating its viability as a world-class heuristic. The entire system is implemented as a full-stack application with a Python/Flask backend and an interactive JavaScript frontend.

## üî¨ Methodology Deep Dive

The algorithm's success is attributed to its three-stage architecture:

#### 1. Resonant Initialization
Instead of a random or greedy start, the initial tour is constructed by projecting the cities' indices onto a one-dimensional space defined by a harmonic sum. Each city `i` is assigned a value `v(i)`:

$$ v(i) = \sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{A}{k} \cos\left(k \cdot \frac{2\pi(i+s)}{n}\right) $$

where `n` is the number of cities, `N` is the number of harmonics, `A` is the amplitude, and `s` is the phase shift. Sorting the cities by `v(i)` creates a structured, non-trivial initial tour that serves as a high-quality seed for optimization.

#### 2. High-Quality Local Search
The core optimization engine is a **"Best Improvement" 2-Opt** algorithm. Unlike a standard "First Improvement" strategy, this implementation evaluates all possible 2-edge swaps in an iteration and applies only the one that provides the largest cost reduction. This leads to a more robust descent into a high-quality local optimum.

#### 3. Iterated Local Search (ILS)
To escape the basins of local optima, the ILS meta-heuristic is employed. The main loop is as follows:
1.  Find an initial local optimum using the Resonant Initialization + 2-Opt.
2.  **Perturb** the solution using a **double-bridge move** (a type of 4-Opt move) to "kick" it into a new region of the solution space.
3.  Apply the **Best Improvement 2-Opt** to this new, perturbed solution to find its local optimum.
4.  If this new optimum is better than the global best found so far, accept it.
5.  Repeat for a set number of iterations.

This combination of a smart initialization and a powerful search/escape mechanism is the key to the algorithm's elite performance.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The project is a full-stack application.

#### Backend (Python API)
The backend contains the core solver and a Flask API.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-Cors
    ```
2.  **Run the API Server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python app.py
    ```
    The server will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

#### Frontend (Web Interface)
The frontend provides an interactive interface to the solver.

1.  **Start the Backend Server** as described above.
2.  **Open `frontend/index.html`** in a modern web browser.
3.  Load a `.tsp` file, set the resonant parameters, and click "Rodar algoritmo" to send the problem to the Python backend and visualize the result.
